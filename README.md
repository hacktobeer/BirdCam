# BirdCam

TL;DR: DIY project to build a bird nest box with day/night webcam, live YouTube streaming, motion detection and controlled from a RaspberryPi. Contains used scripts and configuration wiki page on how to set this up.

See [wiki](https://github.com/hacktobeer/BirdCam/wiki) for details.

As a side project my son and I decided to build a bird nest box with a camera. We wanted to include day and night vision, live Youtube streaming, motion detection and the automatic notification and uploading of pictures and videos to Google Photos when activity is detected in the nest box. 
Hardware used for this project:
- Home made wooden nest box
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+
- Golbong HD IR camera 4901
- TP-Link SmartPlug HS100

Youtube Live stream can be found at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Pf8IP4lVH4J-U2FYaacww/live

This repo contains the scripts we are using and are referenced in the setup wiki page.

Feel free to open up an issue if you have any questions.
